[Supervised Machine Learning Models (Machine Learning, various regression models)](https://github.com/kylejlynch/Assignments/blob/master/Assignment%2B2.ipynb)\
Practice using various supervised machine learning models - Polynomial LinearRegression, Ridge and Lasso linear regression, Support Vector Classifiers. Recognizing overfit and underfit models.

[Fruits Dataset (Machine Learning, k-Nearest Neighbors)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kylejlynch/Assignments/blob/master/k-NN_Feature_Improvement.ipynb)\
Generation of Intensive Features (Density) from Extensive Features (mass, height, width) and modeling fruit as ellipsoids to improve k-Nearest Neighbors classification.

[Energy Indicators](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kylejlynch/Select_Assignments/blob/master/Assignment3.ipynb)\
Data extraction and cleaning of the csv file Energy Indicators.xls, which is a list of indicators of energy supply and renewable electricity production from the United Nations for the year 2013. Displays use of Pandas, regular expressions, Numpy, lambda functions, and list comprehension.

[Effects of Recessions on University Towns (Large Data, statistical analysis)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kylejlynch/Select_Assignments/blob/master/Assignment4.ipynb)\
Use of Pandas and SciPy Stats (t-tests) on a large dataset to test a hypothesis that university towns are less effected by recessions than non-university towns.
